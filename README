Reverse and Add - c++ Code Eval medium challenge

Given an integer < 10,000, reverse the integer and add the two.
If the sum is a palindrome, print the number of iterations (i.e.
reversals and additions) and the result.
If not a palindrome, repeat the reversal and add until the
result is a palindrome.
